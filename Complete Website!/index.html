            <p class="lead">Over the last five years Hollywood has come under fire for lack of representation in film. White males make up most of the roles on screen and an ever-larger portion of the roles off-screen. Audiences are beginning to hold film creators accountable for the lack of diversity. For a young student, representation on screen is extremely important. It impacts how they see themselves and others. Entertainment companies have a lot of power over what people watch. Some believe these companies have an obligation to share diverse experiences and provide equal representation. <br><br></p>

              <p> "Having your story told as a woman, as a person of color, as a lesbian, or as a trans person or as any member of any disenfranchised community is sadly often still a radical idea.

      <p>Organizations such as Women in Film are working to change the lack of diversity on and off screen. In the U.S., women comprised just 8% of directors working on the top 250 US domestic grossing films in 2018. Women are not given the same opportunities in film as men are. Studies have shown that humans have a tendency to recruit others that are similar to themselves. Men make up most of the top-level producers in Hollywood. Only 26% of producers in Hollywood are women. If men are the ones hiring directors and production teams, they are more likely to hire men than women. The Women in Film organization an initiative called “Hire Her Back,” a few weeks ago. The initiative plans to put pressure on entertainment companies to seek gender and racial equality in their future hiring after the COVID-19 shutdown. This initiative comes at the same time as many celebrities are stepping down from positions and roles in order to promote more diverse casting. Jenny Slate recently announced that she will no longer voice the character Missy on the animated TV show “Big Mouth.” Missy is a young black girl in the show. Slate announced on Instagram that her voicing Missy was “an act of erasure of Black people.” She has asked that the creators recast a Black actress. Kristen Bell also announced that she will no longer voice the mixed-race character Molly on Apple TV’s new animated series “Central Park.”
